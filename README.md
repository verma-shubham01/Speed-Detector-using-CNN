A Simple Data Science based project that detects the speed of the Car using OpenCV and Flask (Interaction between frontend and backend)


### Dependencies
1. OpenCV-Python
2. Flask
3. Dlib
4. Numpy

    Make sure that the directory is set as `V-core` because I've made bunch of implementations including dataset connection with the exact name in path section.
